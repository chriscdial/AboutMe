# Snapshot

The 5 things I feel like are the most important things to know about me up front

* I'm a firefighterüî•! Not as a profession, but I always find the hole in the team and learn what I need to fill it! I'm the guy that works until midnight rolling encryption certificates so save us downtime tomorrow, or has to spend a month learning how smart cards work to write new authentication code, and I'm the guy in sprint planning that takes those assignments no one else wants to work on.

* I'm malleable! I work all over the stack, and I like working on full-feature implementations. Something new or different with your tech-stack doesn't scare me, I can absolutely learn it! I **strongly** believe in the Agile principles, but I also know that there are situations were the business must come first and the rules must be tweaked to balance what we all want. Your coding standards won't bother me (and if you don't have any we can fix that too), unless you believe in trailing-brace comments. If you do, please lose my application! üòÜ

* Building a Career is my #1 priority. I don't like to move around a lot, and if I'm applying to a position it's because I want to contribute to the companys' success and also grow with them. I'm at the point where stability is important to me, and being able to stay with the same company is nearing the top of my priority list.

* I do my best work in **my** office. I've been fully-remote since 2018, and I truly believe I'm the most productive I've ever been. I am a bit of an introvert, and I find it stressful to work off of a laptop in some hotel conference room. Now this is not so say that I won't travel at all, I've traveled quite frequently for product launches, and important customer meetings. However, it seems increasingly common to expect employees to attend a 2 week 'meet up' 3 or 4 times a year and I don't see that working for me.

* I will need time for continued learning. I have plans to go back to school and pursue my Masters and I also really want to get into AI development and working with LLMs. I will certainly pursue these things around my work commitments, but just know that if always being on-call and immediately available after normal work hours is important to you.... we'll need to talk about when I can have some guaranteed time to broaden my horizons!

# Availability

I'm usually online at ~9:00 AM until 6 or 7 PM Central, but I'm pretty flexible on my work hours so whatever works best for the team.

I am **not** one of those 'glued to my phone' kinda people. If we communicate through Teams or Slack I expect the vast majority of communication will occur there, including things coming from management and the business side of the company. I do check my emails and calls/texts a few times a day, but for anything time-sensitive I'm expecting to see it in Teams or Slack.

I really try to keep my calendar up to date, even with things that aren't work-related but I know are going to take my time or attention. So if you ever want to talk with me just set up a meeting and lets discuss what's on your mind.

Along those lines, I'm a very 'asynchronous' communicator. With people working remotely from across the US (or even the globe now) it's increasingly common for team members to be online at different times. So I may send msgs to the team outside of normal work hours, but if I do it's intended as a 'note for tomorrow' kind of thing. Unless I specifically say I need to know something urgently I'm not expecting a response until you're back online. This is also how I expect to be communicated with, we all have the right to enjoy our downtime and recharge before tomorrow starts!

# My Strengths

* Clean and Thought-Out Code - I am an engineer and I consider maintainability, reusability, and testability in all of my code. Most of the time when I start working on a new ticket I spend the first ~30 minutes just thinking about my implementation and how it's going to interact with the current code. I don't like writing sloppy code, and I don't like rushing a solution that doesn't consider edge-cases or potential data issues. I also consider myself an 'iterative developer' and I will quite frequently refactor new code a couple times to make it more maintainable, or more testable. All of this has the drawback of struggling with live coding interviews because it's just not the way I code, but it's something I'm working on improving.

* True Full-Stack Skills - When I say that I'm full-stack I mean it. Now I certainly still have areas where I'm best (btw best to worst that would be middle-tier (server side) -> front-end -> database), but I can work anywhere, and I can implement full features myself. 

* Learning new things - I have a knack for picking up new things quickly, and I don't mean that in the normal job applicant clich√©. I can pick up something completely new and develop a new feature in the app based on it. Got new smart cards and no one on the team knows APDU commands? I'll learn BER-TLV encoding and write new authentication code to work with them. Customer asked to integrate through an api orchestrator no one has experience with? I'll learn their platform, build and test the automation with the client, and get that integration working! Do we need to improve our CI/CD and get more of our infrastructure under source control? I'm off to learn ARM templates and Terraform and building new pipelines to make us more automated!

# What I'm Working On

* Balancing 'delivery vs team growth' - when I become an expert in an area of the application I tend to always take the work related to it during sprint planning. However, over a long period of time this takes away the opportunity for the other team members to learn about it and for that knowledge to be spread around the team. I have been working on taking the work when it's time-sensitive, but also 'supervising' one of my teammates when the work is an easier task, or something that doesn't have an impending deadline.

* Keeping my blinders on - semi-related to my 'Clean and Thought-Out Code' block above, but I often struggle with trying to fix everything, all at once. It bothers me to leave something festering in the code base and to just create another ticket to come back and fix it later. I've been working on improving this by restricting bug-fixes to code that is touched by the testing class my new/updated tests are in. I like clean commits that don't have a bunch of randomly changed files, so I think it works pretty well to restrain myself.

* Multi-tasking - I know this isn't a great one to put out there, but it's simply the truth. I don't mean small stuff like creating my timesheet during my workday. It's very stressful for me to stop working on one task and change to something completely different every couple of days. Now working on multiple things in a sprint isn't an issue for me. I just need to be able to finish my work on one item before starting on another. Otherwise I have them both 'open' in my brain and I feel like I can't focus. This is something I ask my supervisor to work with me on, just give me a properly prioritized list of work and don't expect #3 before #2. It's inevitable for it to happen occasionally, but for me it's important to minimize it.

# Miscellaneous

Despite blabbering on about myself for 4 pages now I am much more of a 'team success' kind of person, possibly even to a fault. One of my supervisors once told me that I should "claim my victories and accept direct praise" a little more often. 

I **really** hope the team has a 'levity' channel in Teams/Slack, humor is the spice of life and I will definitely take any opportunity to brighten up the day and give everyone something to laugh at.
